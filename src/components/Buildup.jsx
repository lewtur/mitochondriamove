      <h1>The social network of mitochondria</h1>
      <p>
        As they move around the cell, these mitochondria come within a close distance of each other-
        they interact. We can think of these interactions as a social network (think about your Facebook
        friends, a crowd of people or even a colony of ants moving about).
      </p>
      <p>
        An interaction here is when two mitochondria come close to each other. We draw each
        mitochondria as a blue blob (node) and each time they meet up, we draw a stick (edge)
        between them. This way we get a complete history of who has ‘met up’ with who!
